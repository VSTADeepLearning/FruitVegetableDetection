# Fruit and Vegetable Detection

## Authors: Varun Saini and Tasfiq Ahmed

## Description:
This project focuses on detecting various fruits and vegetables from a Kaggle image database (https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) using deep learning techniques. This is primarily an object detection project (multiclass classification), but it could become a multilabel classification project in the future (detecting multiple fruits in images containing more than one type).
